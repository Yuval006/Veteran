Hello students

This is the repository of the Veteran bash project!


-------------       Insructions       -------------

In this project you'll be working together in order to create a one gigantic bash script called Veteran.sh
The end goal is a bash script that can get 1 - 7 flags and perform all of the Veteran Level tasks respectively!

I know that its sounds hard but with teamwork and good collaboration its actually much easier then you might think.

--- HOW? ---


You'll be divided into 4 teams.
The first 3 teams is responsible for coding 2 tasks.
The 4th team will be incharge of 1 task and the Veteran.sh file.


--- VETERAN.SH ---

The veteran.sh file is a file that imports all of the other tasks and use getopts in order to create flags for each command.

Veteran.sh Usage:      ./Veteran.sh -[1-7] [Arguments relevant for the task chosen...] 

For example: ./Veteran -2 "test.txt" ";"

Will output the test file content fields seperated by ";"



--- Folders & Files hierarchy  ---

First things first, before you start coding, gather all of your team and establish git strategy and folder & files hierarchy.

You can use the createFolders.sh in order to create your folder and files hierarchy.

Usage: ./createFolders.sh <number_of_exercises>

The script will create numbered folders with numbered bash files.


--- Start working  ---

After Establishing and creating your folders & files structure, commit and push the changes to master.

Create branches needed for the git strategy you chose and start working!



-------------   !!! Important Notes Before starting the assignment !!!  -------------


1. Choose git startegy as a team - when and if to merge/rebase... 

2. Define remote work branches that will be in use.

3. Define local work branches for every team.

4. Make sure that everyone knows their responsabilities.

5. Communicate while working and before making significant changes.

6. Don't forget to test before pushing!

7. Don't forget Error handling!

8. If designed correctly, adding more tasks to the Veteran.sh should be very easy.
